### Project Plan and Approach for Auto Driving Car Simulator

#### 1. **Project Overview**
To simulate the movement of cars on a grid. Each car can execute a series of commands to move forward, rotate left, or rotate right. The system should handle both single-car and multi-car scenarios, including collision detection.

#### 2. **High-Level Design**
The project is divided into several modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of the simulation:

1. **Core Components**:
    - **Car**: Represents a car with its position, direction, and commands.
    - **Grid**: Represents the grid on which cars move.
    - **Direction**: Enum to represent the four cardinal directions (NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, WEST).

2. **Commands**:
    - **BaseCommand**: Abstract base class for all commands.
    - **MoveForwardCommand**: Command to move the car forward.
    - **RotateLeftCommand**: Command to rotate the car left.
    - **RotateRightCommand**: Command to rotate the car right.
    - **CommandFactory**: Factory to create command instances based on input strings.

3. **Collision Handling**:
    - **CollisionEvent**: Represents a collision event.
    - **CollisionStrategy**: Abstract base class for collision detection strategies.
    - **SimpleCollisionStrategy**: Basic collision detection strategy.
    - **AdvancedCollisionStrategy**: Advanced collision detection strategy (to be implemented).
    - **CollisionHandler**: Handles collision detection using a specified strategy.

4. **Parsers**:
    - **InputParser**: Parses input data to create grid, car, and command instances.

5. **Simulators**:
    - **SingleCarSimulator**: Simulates the movement of a single car.
    - **MultiCarSimulator**: Simulates the movement of multiple cars and detects collisions.

6. **Utilities**:
    - **DirectionUtils**: Utility functions to correctly transition the state of the car.

#### 3. **Detailed Design**

1. **Car Class**:
    - Attributes: `identifier`, `x`, `y`, `direction`, `commands`.
    - Methods: `get_position`.

2. **Grid Class**:
    - Attributes: `width`, `height`.
    - Methods: `is_within_bounds`.

3. **Direction Enum**:
    - Values: `NORTH`, `EAST`, `SOUTH`, `WEST`.
    - Methods: `from_string`, `to_string`, `move_forward`, `rotate_left`, `rotate_right`.

4. **Commands**:
    - **BaseCommand**: Abstract class with `execute` method.
    - **MoveForwardCommand**: Implements `execute` to move the car forward.
    - **RotateLeftCommand**: Implements `execute` to rotate the car left.
    - **RotateRightCommand**: Implements `execute` to rotate the car right.
    - **CommandFactory**: Static method `create_command` to create command instances.

5. **Collision Handling**:
    - **CollisionEvent**: Attributes: `collided_cars`, `position`, `step`.
    - **CollisionStrategy**: Abstract class with `detect_collisions` method.
    - **SimpleCollisionStrategy**: Implements `detect_collisions` to detect collisions.
    - **AdvancedCollisionStrategy**: Placeholder for advanced collision detection.
    - **CollisionHandler**: Uses a strategy to detect collisions.

6. **Parsers**:
    - **InputParser**: Methods to parse single and multiple car inputs.

7. **Simulators**:
    - **SingleCarSimulator**: Simulates a single car.
    - **MultiCarSimulator**: Simulates multiple cars and detects collisions.

#### 4. **Design Patterns Used**

1. **Factory Pattern**:
    - **CommandFactory**: Used to create instances of command objects based on input strings. This pattern helps in encapsulating the instantiation logic and makes the code more modular and maintainable.

2. **Strategy Pattern**:
    - **CollisionStrategy**: Abstract base class for different collision detection strategies. This pattern allows for different algorithms to be used interchangeably for collision detection.
    - **SimpleCollisionStrategy** and **AdvancedCollisionStrategy**: Concrete implementations of the `CollisionStrategy`.

3. **Command Pattern**:
    - **BaseCommand** and its subclasses (`MoveForwardCommand`, `RotateLeftCommand`, `RotateRightCommand`): Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.

#### 5. **Testing Plan**

1. **Unit Tests**:
    - Test individual components (e.g., `Car`, `Grid`, `Direction`, commands).

2. **Integration Tests**:
    - Test interactions between components (e.g., `Car` executing commands on `Grid`).

3. **End-to-End Tests**:
    - Test complete scenarios (e.g., single car simulation, multiple car simulation with collisions).

4. **Edge Cases**:
    - Test edge cases (e.g., car moving out of bounds, simultaneous collisions).
